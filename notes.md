# AI Agent

### Non-Agentic Workflow

- One-Pass execution: completes a task in one go, without iteration
- No adjustments
- E.g.,: prompting ChatGPT

### Agentic Workflow

- Step-by-step execution: Breaks tasks into stages (planning, research, drafting, revising)
- Feedback loop: AI iterates based on human guidance

### Autonomous AI Agent

- Fully independent AI: AI determines steps, tools, and iterates without human involvment
- Adaptive decision-making: AI adjusts workflow dynamically to achieve the best outcome
